# Default Profile Picture

This directory is where user profile pictures will be stored. You need to add a default profile picture named `default.webp` in this directory.

The default profile picture should be:
1. Named exactly `default.webp`
2. A square image (recommended size: 256x256 pixels)
3. In WebP format
4. Professional and neutral in appearance

You can use any appropriate default avatar image, such as:
- A simple user icon
- A placeholder silhouette
- A neutral avatar design

Once you add the default.webp file here, it will be used as the default profile picture for all new users who don't upload their own picture.
